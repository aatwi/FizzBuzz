# FizzBuzz
In this project, I am solving the simple FizzBuzz problem using TDD. 
The aim of this maven project is to introduce our newcomers to two concepts (TDD & CI) we use at our company.
The idea is the following: 
* I will introduce a bug in the code
* Ask newcomers to: 
    * Configure Jenkins instance on their local machines
    * Add a job and link it to this project (of course the job will be red after my bug)
    * Make the job green again. 
    
Doing this exercise, they are expected to understand how to configure and work with a CI instance and how to read and debug an existing code.
